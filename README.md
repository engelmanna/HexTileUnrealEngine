# HexTileUnrealEngine

An implementation within Unreal Engine of "Practical Real-Time Hex-Tiling" using only material nodes. This specific material was built out to learn more about how the technique works, and to see if it was possible to build without custom HLSL nodes. I really enjoyed putting this together and learned a lot, I hope you do to!

This technique is not mine. It's based on this paper by Morten Mikkelsen: [Practical Real-Time Hex-Tiling](https://jcgt.org/published/0011/03/05/)
